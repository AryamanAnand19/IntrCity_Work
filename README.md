Internship basic work display

During my internship, I was tasked with creating a dashboard to analyze historical bus service delays using Python and React. I incorporated Leaflet for interactive map displays and functionalities. The primary use case for this project is to offer a comprehensive tool to visualize and understand patterns in bus service delays, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making to optimize routes, schedules, and overall service efficiency.
